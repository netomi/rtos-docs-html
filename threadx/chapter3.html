<h1>Chapter 3 - Functional Components of ThreadX</h1>
</div>
<div id="content">
<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter contains a description of the high-performance ThreadX kernel from a functional perspective. Each functional component is presented in an easy-to-understand manner.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_execution_overview">Execution Overview</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are four types of program execution within a ThreadX application: Initialization, Thread Execution, Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs), and Application Timers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Figure 2 shows each different type of program execution. More detailed information about each of these types is found in subsequent sections of this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_initialization">Initialization</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the name implies, this is the first type of program execution in a ThreadX application. Initialization includes all program execution between processor reset and the entry point of the <em>thread scheduling loop.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_thread_execution">Thread Execution</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After initialization is complete, ThreadX enters its thread scheduling loop. The scheduling loop looks for an application thread ready for execution. When a ready thread is found, ThreadX transfers control to it. After the thread is finished (or another higher-priority thread becomes ready), execution transfers back to the thread scheduling loop to find the next highest priority ready thread.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This process of continually executing and scheduling threads is the most common type of program execution in ThreadX applications.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_interrupt_service_routines_isr">Interrupt Service Routines (ISR)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interrupts are the cornerstone of real-time systems. Without interrupts it would be extremely difficult to respond to changes in the external world in a timely manner. On detection of an interrupt, the processor saves key information about the current program execution (usually on the stack), then transfers control to a predefined program area. This predefined program area is commonly called an Interrupt Service Routine. In most cases, interrupts occur during thread execution (or in the thread scheduling loop). However, interrupts may also occur inside of an executing ISR or an Application Timer.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_application_timers">Application Timers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Application Timers are similar to ISRs, except the hardware implementation (usually a single periodic hardware interrupt is used) is hidden from the application. Such timers are used by
applications to perform time-outs, periodics, and/or watchdog services. Just like ISRs, Application Timers most often interrupt thread execution. Unlike ISRs, however, Application Timers cannot interrupt each other.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_memory_usage">Memory Usage</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ThreadX resides along with the application program. As a result, the static memory (or fixed memory) usage of ThreadX is determined by the development tools; e.g., the
compiler, linker, and locator. Dynamic memory (or run-time memory) usage is under direct control of the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_static_memory_usage">Static Memory Usage</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the development tools divide the application program image into five basic areas: <em>instruction</em>, <em>constant</em>, <em>initialized data</em>, <em>uninitialized data</em>, and <em>system
stack</em>. Figure 3 shows an example of these memory areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to understand that this is only an example. The actual static memory layout is specific to the processor, development tools, and the underlying hardware.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The instruction area contains all of the program&#8217;s processor instructions. This area is typically the largest and is often located in ROM.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The constant area contains various compiled constants, including strings defined or referenced within the program. In addition, this area contains the "initial copy" of the initialized data area. During the <em>Memory Usage</em> compiler&#8217;s initialization process, this portion of the constant area is used to set up the initialized data area in RAM. The constant area usually follows the instruction area and is often located in ROM.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The initialized data and uninitialized data areas contain all of the global and static variables. These areas are always located in RAM.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The system stack is generally set up immediately following the initialized and uninitialized data areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The system stack is used by the compiler during initialization, then by ThreadX during initialization and, subsequently, in ISR processing.</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_dynamic_memory_usage">Dynamic Memory Usage</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned before, dynamic memory usage is under direct control of the application. Control blocks and memory areas associated with stacks, queues, and memory pools can be placed anywhere in the target&#8217;s memory space. This is an important feature because it facilitates easy utilization of different types of physical memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, suppose a target hardware environment has both fast memory and slow memory. If the application needs extra performance for a high-priority thread, its control block
(TX_THREAD) and stack can be placed in the fast memory area, which may greatly enhance its performance.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_initialization_2">Initialization</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Understanding the initialization process is important. The initial hardware environment is set up here. In addition, this is where the application is given its initial personality.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_system_reset_vector">System Reset Vector</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All microprocessors have reset logic. When a reset occurs (either hardware or software), the address of the application&#8217;s entry point is retrieved from a specific memory location. After the entry point is retrieved, the processor transfers control to that location. The application entry point is quite often written in the native assembly language and is usually supplied by the development tools (at least in template form). In some cases, a special version of the entry program is supplied with ThreadX.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_development_tool_initialization">Development Tool Initialization</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the low-level initialization is complete, control transfers to the development tool&#8217;s high-level initialization. This is usually the place where initialized global and static C variables are set up. Remember their initial values are retrieved from the constant area. Exact initialization processing is development tool specific.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_main_function">main Function</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the development tool initialization is complete, control transfers to the user-supplied <em>main</em> function. At this point, the application controls what happens next. For most applications, the main function simply calls <em>tx_kernel_enter</em>, which is the entry into ThreadX. However, applications can perform preliminary processing (usually for hardware initialization) prior to entering ThreadX.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When <strong><em>tx_application_define</em></strong> returns, control is transferred to the thread scheduling loop. This marks the end of initialization.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_application_definition_function">Application Definition Function</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong><em>tx_application_define</em></strong> function defines all of the initial application threads, queues, semaphores, mutexes, event flags, memory pools, and timers. It is also possible to create and delete system resources from threads during the normal operation of the application. However, all initial application resources are defined here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong><em>tx_application_define</em></strong> function has a single input parameter and it is certainly worth mentioning. The <em>first-available</em> RAM address is the sole input parameter to this function. It is typically used as a starting point for initial run-time memory allocations of thread stacks, queues, and memory pools.</p>

<h3 id="_interrupts">Interrupts</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interrupts are left disabled during the entire initialization process. If the application somehow enables interrupts, unpredictable behavior may occur. Figure 4 shows the entire
initialization process, from system reset through application-specific initialization.</p>

<h2 id="_thread_execution_2">Thread Execution</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scheduling and executing application threads is the most important activity of ThreadX. A thread is typically defined as a semi-independent program segment with a dedicated purpose. The
combined processing of all threads makes an application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Threads are created dynamically by calling <strong><em>tx_thread_create</em></strong> during initialization or during thread execution. Threads are created in either a <em>ready</em> or <em>suspended</em> state.</p>

<h3 id="_thread_execution_states">Thread Execution States</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Understanding the different processing states of threads is a key ingredient to understanding the entire multithreaded environment. In ThreadX there are five distinct thread states:
<em>ready</em>, <em>suspended</em>, <em>executing</em>, <em>terminated</em>, and <em>completed</em>. Figure 5 shows the thread state transition diagram for ThreadX.</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>FIGURE 5. Thread State Transition</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A thread is in a <em>ready</em> state when it is ready for execution. A ready thread is not executed until it is the highest priority thread in ready state. When this happens, ThreadX executes the thread, which then changes its state to <em>executing</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a higher-priority thread becomes ready, the executing thread reverts back to a <em>ready</em> state. The newly ready high-priority thread is then executed, which changes its logical state to <em>executing</em>. This transition between <em>ready</em> and <em>executing</em> states occurs every time thread preemption occurs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At any given moment, only one thread is in an <em>executing</em> state. This is because a thread in the <em>executing</em> state has control of the underlying processor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Threads in a <em>suspended</em> state are not eligible for execution. Reasons for being in a <em>suspended</em> state include suspension for time, queue messages, semaphores, mutexes, event flags, memory, and basic thread suspension. After the cause for suspension is removed, the thread is placed back in a <em>ready</em> state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A thread in a <em>completed</em> state is a thread that has completed its processing and returned from its entry function. The entry function is specified during thread creation. A thread in a <em>completed</em> state cannot execute again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A thread is in a <em>terminated</em> state because another thread or the thread itself called the <em>tx_thread_terminate</em> service. A thread in a <em>terminated</em> state cannot execute again.</p>

<h3 id="_thread_entryexit_notification">Thread Entry/Exit Notification</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some applications may find it advantageous to be notified when a specific thread is entered for the first time, when it completes, or is terminated. ThreadX provides this ability through the <strong><em>tx_thread_entry_exit_notify</em></strong> service. This service registers an application notification function for a specific thread, which is called by ThreadX whenever the thread starts running, completes, or is terminated. After being invoked, the application notification function can perform the application-specific processing. This typically involves informing another application thread of the event via a ThreadX synchronization primitive.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, a thread is a semi-independent program segment with a dedicated purpose. However, all threads are not created equal! The dedicated purpose of some threads is much more important than others. This heterogeneous type of thread importance is a hallmark of embedded realtime applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ThreadX determines a thread&#8217;s importance when the thread is created by assigning a numerical value representing its <em>priority</em>. The maximum number of ThreadX priorities is configurable from 32 through 1024 in increments of 32. The actual maximum number of priorities is determined by the <strong>TX_MAX_PRIORITIES</strong> constant during compilation of the ThreadX library. Having a larger number of priorities does not significantly increase processing overhead. However, for each group of 32 priority levels an additional 128 bytes of RAM is required to manage them. For example, 32 priority levels require 128 bytes of RAM, 64 priority levels require 256 bytes of RAM, and 96 priority levels requires 384 bytes of RAM.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, ThreadX has 32 priority levels, ranging from priority 0 through priority 31. Numerically smaller values imply higher priority. Hence, priority 0 represents the highest priority, while priority (<strong>TX_MAX_PRIORITIES</strong>-1) represents the lowest priority.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multiple threads can have the same priority relying on cooperative scheduling or time-slicing. In addition, thread priorities can be changed during run-time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_thread_scheduling">Thread Scheduling</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ThreadX schedules threads based on their priority. The ready thread with the highest priority is executed first. If multiple threads of the same priority are ready, they are executed in a <em>first-in-first-out</em> (FIFO) manner.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_round_robin_scheduling">Round-robin Scheduling</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ThreadX supports <em>round-robin</em> scheduling of multiple threads having the same priority. This is accomplished through cooperative calls to <strong><em>tx_thread_relinquish</em></strong>. This service gives all other ready threads of the same priority a chance to execute before the <strong><em>tx_thread_relinquish</em></strong> caller executes again.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_time_slicing">Time-Slicing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Time-slicing</em> is another form of round-robin scheduling. A time-slice specifies the maximum number of timer ticks (timer interrupts) that a thread can execute without giving up the
processor. In ThreadX, time-slicing is available on a per-thread basis. The thread&#8217;s time-slice is assigned during creation and can be modified during run-time. When a time-slice expires, all other ready threads of the same priority level are given a chance to execute before the time-sliced thread executes again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A fresh thread time-slice is given to a thread after it suspends, relinquishes, makes a ThreadX service call that causes preemption, or is itself time-sliced.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a time-sliced thread is preempted, it will resume before other ready threads of equal priority for the remainder of its time-slice.</p>

<h3 id="_preemption">Preemption</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Preemption is the process of temporarily interrupting an executing thread in favor of a higher-priority thread. This process is invisible to the executing thread. When the higher-priority thread is finished, control is transferred back to the exact place where the preemption took place. This is a very important feature in real-time systems because it facilitates fast response to important application events. Although a very important feature, preemption can also be a source of a variety of problems, including starvation, excessive overhead, and priority inversion.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_preemption_threshold">Preemption Threshold</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To ease some of the inherent problems of preemption, ThreadX provides a unique and advanced feature called <em>preemption-threshold</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A preemption-threshold allows a thread to specify a priority <em>ceiling</em> for disabling preemption. Threads that have higher priorities than the ceiling are still allowed to preempt, while those less than the ceiling are not allowed to preempt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, suppose a thread of priority 20 only interacts with a group of threads that have priorities between 15 and 20. During its critical sections, the thread of priority 20 can set its preemption-threshold to 15, thereby preventing preemption from all of the threads that it interacts with. This still permits really important threads (priorities between 0 and 14) to preempt this thread during its critical section processing, which results in much more responsive processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, it is still possible for a thread to disable all preemption by setting its preemption-threshold to 0. In addition, preemption-threshold can be changed during run-time.</p>

<h3 id="_priority_inheritance">Priority Inheritance</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ThreadX also supports optional priority inheritance within its mutex services described later in this chapter. Priority inheritance allows a lower priority thread to temporarily assume the priority of a high priority thread that is waiting for a mutex owned by the lower priority thread. This capability helps the application to avoid nondeterministic priority inversion by eliminating preemption of intermediate thread priorities. Of course, <em>preemption-threshold</em> may be used to achieve a similar result.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Locating the control block in other areas requires a bit more care, just like all dynamically-allocated memory. If a control block is allocated within a C function, the memory associated with it is part of the calling thread&#8217;s stack.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned before, there is only one thread executing at any given time. There are several ways to identify the executing thread, depending on which thread is making the request.
A program segment can get the control block address of the executing thread by calling <strong><em>tx_thread_identify</em></strong>. This is useful in shared portions of application code that are executed from multiple threads.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In debug sessions, users can examine the internal ThreadX pointer <strong><em>_tx_thread_current_ptr</em></strong>. It contains the control block address of the currently executing thread.

<h3 id="_thread_stack_area">Thread Stack Area</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each thread must have its own stack for saving the context of its last execution and compiler use. Most C compilers use the stack for making function calls and for temporarily allocating local variables. Figure 6 shows a typical thread&#8217;s stack.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where a thread stack is located in memory is up to the application. The stack area is specified during thread creation and can be located anywhere in the target&#8217;s address space. This is an important feature because it allows applications to improve performance of important threads by placing their stack in high-speed RAM.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>How big a stack should be is one of the most frequently asked questions about threads. A thread&#8217;s stack area must be large enough to accommodate worst-case function call nesting, local variable allocation, and saving its last execution context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The minimum stack size, <strong>TX_MINIMUM_STACK</strong>, is defined by ThreadX. A stack of this size supports saving a thread&#8217;s context and minimum amount of function calls and local variable allocation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For most threads, however, the minimum stack size is too small, and the user must ascertain the worst-case size requirement by examining function-call nesting and local variable allocation. Of course, it is always better to start with a larger stack area.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the application is debugged, it is possible to tune the thread stack sizes if memory is scarce. A favorite trick is to preset all stack areas with an easily identifiable data pattern like (0xEFEF) prior to creating the threads. After the application has been thoroughly put through its paces, the stack areas can be examined to see how much stack was actually used by finding the area of the stack where the data pattern is still intact. Figure 7 shows a stack preset to 0xEFEF after thorough thread execution.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The stack requirements for threads can be large. Therefore, it is important to design the application to have a reasonable number of threads. Furthermore, some care must be taken to avoid excessive stack usage within threads. Recursive algorithms and large local data structures should be avoided.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, an overflowed stack causes thread execution to corrupt memory adjacent (usually before) its stack area. The results are unpredictable, but most often result in an unnatural change in the program counter. This is often called "jumping into the weeds." Of course, the only way to prevent this is to ensure all thread stacks are large enough.</p>

<h3 id="_optional_run_time_stack_checking">Optional Run-time Stack Checking</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ThreadX provides the ability to check each thread&#8217;s stack for corruption during run-time. By default, ThreadX fills every byte of thread stacks with a 0xEF data pattern during creation. If the application builds the ThreadX library with <strong>TX_ENABLE_STACK_CHECKING</strong> defined, ThreadX will examine each thread&#8217;s stack for corruption as it is suspended or resumed. If stack corruption is detected, ThreadX will call the application&#8217;s stack error handling routine as specified by the call to <strong><em>tx_thread_stack_error_notify</em></strong>. Otherwise, if no stack error handler was specified, ThreadX will call the internal <strong><em>_tx_thread_stack_error_handler</em></strong> routine.</p>

<h3 id="_reentrancy">Reentrancy</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the real beauties of multithreading is that the same C function can be called from multiple threads. This provides great power and also helps reduce code space. However, it does require that C functions called from multiple threads are <em>reentrant</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Basically, a reentrant function stores the caller&#8217;s return address on the current stack and does not rely on global or static C variables that it previously set up. Most compilers place the return address on the stack. Hence, application developers must only worry about the use of <em>globals</em> and <em>statics</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An example of a non-reentrant function is the string token function <strong><em>strtok</em></strong> found in the standard C library. This function "remembers" the previous string pointer on subsequent calls. It does this with a static string pointer. If this function is called from multiple threads, it would most likely return an invalid pointer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_thread_priority_pitfalls">Thread Priority Pitfalls</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Selecting thread priorities is one of the most important aspects of multithreading. It is sometimes very tempting to assign priorities based on a perceived notion of thread importance rather than determining what is exactly required during run-time. Misuse of thread priorities can starve other threads, create priority inversion, reduce processing bandwidth, and make the application&#8217;s run-time behavior difficult to understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned before, ThreadX provides a priority-based, preemptive scheduling algorithm. Lower priority threads do not execute until there are no higher priority threads ready for execution. If a higher priority thread is always ready, the lower priority threads never execute. This condition is called <em>thread starvation</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most thread starvation problems are detected early in debug and can be solved by ensuring that higher priority threads don&#8217;t execute continuously. Alternatively, logic can be added to the application that gradually raises the priority of starved threads until they get a chance to execute.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another pitfall associated with thread priorities is <em>priority inversion</em>. Priority inversion takes place when a higher priority thread is suspended because a lower priority thread has a needed resource. Of course, in some instances it is necessary for two threads of different priority to share a common resource. If these threads are the only ones active, the priority inversion time is bounded by the time the lower priority thread holds the resource. This condition is both deterministic and quite normal. However, if threads of
intermediate priority become active during this priority inversion condition, the priority inversion time is no longer deterministic and could cause an application failure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are principally three distinct methods of preventing nondeterministic priority inversion in ThreadX. First, the application priority selections and run-time behavior can be designed in a manner that prevents the priority inversion problem. Second, lower priority threads can utilize <em>preemption threshold</em> to block preemption from intermediate threads
while they share resources with higher priority threads. Finally, threads using ThreadX mutex objects to protect system resources may utilize the optional mutex <em>priority inheritance</em> to eliminate nondeterministic priority inversion.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_priority_overhead">Priority Overhead</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most overlooked ways to reduce overhead in multithreading is to reduce the number of context switches. As previously mentioned, a context switch occurs when execution of a higher priority thread is favored over that of the executing thread. It is worthwhile to mention that higher priority threads can become ready as a result of both external events (like
interrupts) and from service calls made by the executing thread.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To illustrate the effects thread priorities have on context switch overhead, assume a three thread environment with threads named <em>thread_1</em>, <em>thread_2</em>, and <em>thread_3</em>. Assume further that all of the threads are in a state of suspension waiting for a message. When thread_1 receives a message, it immediately forwards it to thread_2. Thread_2 then forwards the message to thread_3. Thread_3 just discards the message. After each thread processes its message, it goes back and waits for another message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The processing required to execute these three threads varies greatly depending on their priorities. If all of the threads have the same priority, a single context switch occurs before the execution of each thread. The context switch occurs when each thread suspends on an empty message queue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, if thread_2 is higher priority than thread_1 and thread_3 is higher priority than thread_2, the number of context switches doubles. This is because another context switch occurs inside of the <em>tx_queue_send</em> service when it detects that a higher priority thread is now ready.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ThreadX preemption-threshold mechanism can avoid these extra context switches and still allow the previously mentioned priority selections. This is an important feature because it allows several thread priorities during scheduling, while at the same time eliminating some of the unwanted context switching between them during thread execution.</p>

For example, a relatively high number of service call preemptions might

<p>Application threads can suspend while attempting to send or receive a message from a queue. Typically, thread suspension involves waiting for a message from an empty queue. However, it is also possible for a thread to suspend trying to send a message to a full queue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the condition for suspension is resolved, the service requested is completed and the waiting thread is resumed. If multiple threads are suspended on the same queue, they are resumed in the order they were suspended (FIFO).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, priority resumption is also possible if the application calls <strong><em>tx_queue_prioritize</em></strong> prior to the queue service that lifts thread suspension. The queue prioritize service places the highest priority thread at the front of the suspension list, while leaving all other suspended threads in the same FIFO order.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Time-outs are also available for all queue suspensions. Basically, a time-out specifies the maximum number of timer ticks the thread will stay suspended. If a time-out occurs, the thread is resumed and the service returns with the appropriate error code.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_queue_send_notification">Queue Send Notification</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some applications may find it advantageous to be notified whenever a message is placed on a queue. ThreadX provides this ability through the <strong><em>tx_queue_send_notify</em></strong> service. This service registers the supplied application notification function with the specified queue. ThreadX will subsequently invoke this application notification function whenever a message is sent to the queue. The exact processing within the application notification function is determined by the application; however, it typically consists of resuming the appropriate thread for processing the new message.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_queue_event_chaining">Queue Event chaining</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The notification capabilities in ThreadX can be used to chain various synchronization events together. This is typically useful when a single thread must process multiple synchronization events.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, suppose a single thread is responsible for processing messages from five different queues and must also suspend when no messages are available. This is easily accomplished by registering an application notification function for each queue and introducing an additional counting semaphore. Specifically, the application notification function performs a <em>tx_semaphore_put</em> whenever it is called (the semaphore count represents the total number of messages in all five queues). The processing thread suspends on this semaphore via the
<em>tx_semaphore_get</em> service. When the semaphore is available (in this case, when a message is available!), the processing thread is resumed. It then interrogates each queue for a message, processes the found message, and performs another <strong><em>tx_semaphore_get</em></strong> to wait for the next message. Accomplishing this without event-chaining is quite difficult and likely would require more threads and/or additional application code.</p>
</div>

<p>This condition is best illustrated by a two thread, two semaphore example. Suppose the first thread owns the first semaphore and the second thread owns the second semaphore. If the first thread attempts to get the second semaphore and at the same time the second thread attempts to get the first semaphore, both threads enter a deadlock condition. In addition, if these threads stay suspended forever, their associated resources are locked-out forever as well. Figure 8 illustrates this example.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Allocating memory in a fast and deterministic manner is always a challenge in real-time applications. With this in mind, ThreadX provides the ability to create and manage multiple pools of fixed-size memory blocks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because memory block pools consist of fixed-size blocks, there are never any fragmentation problems. Of course, fragmentation causes behavior that is inherently nondeterministic. In addition, the time required to allocate and free a fixed-size memory block is comparable to that of simple linked-list manipulation. Furthermore, memory block allocation and de-allocation is done at the head of the available list. This provides the fastest possible linked list processing and might help keep the actual memory block in cache.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lack of flexibility is the main drawback of fixed-size memory pools. The block size of a pool must be large enough to handle the worst case memory requirements of its users. Of course, memory may be wasted if many different size memory requests are made to the same pool. A possible solution is to make several different memory block pools that contain different sized memory blocks.</p>

In addition, the pool is created with two blocks, a large free block and a small permanently allocated block at the end of the memory area. This allocated block is used to improve performance of the allocation algorithm. It eliminates the need to continuously check for the end of the pool area during merging.</p>
