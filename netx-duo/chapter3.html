<h1>Chapter 3 - Functional Components of NetX Duo</h1>
</div>
<div id="content">
<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter contains a description of the high- performance NetX Duo TCP/IP stack from a functional perspective.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_execution_overview">Execution Overview</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are five types of program execution within a NetX Duo application: initialization, application interface calls, internal IP thread, IP periodic timers, and the network driver.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">

</td>

</table>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_initialization">Initialization</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The service <strong><em>nx_system_initialize</em></strong> must be called before any other NetX Duo service is called. System initialization can be called either from the ThreadX <strong><em>tx_application_define</em></strong> function or from application threads.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After <strong><em>nx_system_initialize</em></strong> returns, the system is ready to create packet pools and IP instances. Because creating an IP instance requires a default packet pool, at least one NetX Duo packet pool must exist prior to creating an IP instance. Creating packet pools and IP instances are allowed from the ThreadX initialization function <strong><em>tx_application_define</em></strong> and from application threads.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Internally, creating an IP instance is accomplished in two parts: The first part is done within the context of the caller, either from <strong><em>tx_application_define</em></strong> or from an application thread&#8217;s context. This includes setting up the IP data structure and creating various IP resources, including the internal IP thread. The second part is performed during the initial execution from the internal IP thread. This is where the network driver, supplied during the first part of IP creation, is first called. Calling the network driver from the internal IP thread enables the driver to perform I/O and suspend during its initialization processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the network driver returns from its initialization processing, the IP creation is complete.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Initialization of IPv6 in NetX Duo requires a few additional NetX Duo services. These are described in greater detail in the section <a href="#ipv6-in-netx-duo">IPv6 in NetX Duo</a> later in this chapter.</p>

<em>The NetX Duo service <strong>nx_ip_status_check</strong> is available to obtain information on the IP instance and its primary interface status. Such status information includes whether or not the link is initialized, enabled and IP address is resolved. This information is used to synchronize application threads needing to use a newly created IP instance. For multihome systems, see <a href="#multihome-support">Multihome Support</a>. <strong>nx_ip_interface_status_check</strong> is available to obtain 3information on the specified interface.</em>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_application_interface_calls">Application Interface Calls</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Calls from the application are largely made from application threads running under the ThreadX RTOS. However, some initialization, create, and enable services may be called from <strong><em>tx_application_define</em></strong>. The "Allowed From" sections in <a href="chapter4.html">Chapter 4 - Description of NetX Duo Services</a> indicate from which each NetX Duo service can be called.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the most part, processing intensive activities such as computing checksums is done within the calling thread&#8217;s context&#8212;&#8203;without blocking access of other threads to the IP instance. For example, on transmission, the UDP checksum calculation is performed inside the <strong><em>nx_udp_socket_send</em></strong> service, prior to calling the underlying IP send function. On a received packet, the UDP checksum is calculated in the <strong><em>nx_udp_socket_receive</em></strong> service, executed in the  of the application thread. This helps prevent stalling network requests of higher-priority threads because of processing intensive checksum computation in lower-priority threads.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Values, such as IP addresses and port numbers, are passed to APIs in host byte order. Internally these values are stored in host byte order as well. This allows developers to easily view the values via a debugger. When these values are programmed into a frame for transmission, they are converted to network byte order.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_internal_ip_thread">Internal IP Thread</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned, each IP instance in NetX Duo has its own thread. The priority and stack size of the internal IP thread is defined in the <strong><em>nx_ip_create</em></strong> service. The internal IP thread is created in a ready-to-execute mode. If the IP thread has a higher priority than the calling thread, preemption may occur inside the IP create call.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The entry point of the internal IP thread is at the internal function <em><strong>_nx_ip_thread_entry</em></strong>. When started, the internal IP thread first completes network driver initialization, which consists of making three calls to the application-specific network driver. The first call is to attach the network driver to the IP instance, followed by an initialization call, which allows the network driver to go through the initialization process. After the network driver returns from initialization (it may suspend while waiting for the hardware to be properly set up), the internal IP thread calls the network driver again to enable the link. After the network driver returns from the link enable call, the internal IP thread enters a forever loop checking for various events that need processing for this IP instance. Events processed in this loop include deferred IP packet reception, IP packet fragment assembly, ICMP ping processing, IGMP processing, TCP packet queue processing, TCP periodic processing, IP fragment assembly timeouts, and IGMP periodic processing. Events also include address resolution activities; ARP packet processing and ARP periodic processing in IPv4, Duplicate Address Detection, Router Solicitation, and Neighbor Discovery in IPv6.</p>

<em>The NetX Duo callback functions, including listen and disconnect callbacks, are called from the internal IP thread&#8212;&#8203;not the original calling thread. The application must take care not to suspend inside any NetX Duo callback function.</em>
</td>

</table>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ip_periodic_timers">IP Periodic Timers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two ThreadX periodic timers used for each IP instance. The first one is a one-second timer for ARP, IGMP, TCP timeout, and it also drives IP fragment reassemble processing. The second timer is a 100ms timer to drive the TCP retransmission timeout and IPv6-related operations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_network_driver">Network Driver</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each IP instance in NetX Duo has a primary interface, which is identified by its device driver specified in the <strong><em>nx_ip_create</em></strong> service. The network driver is responsible for handling various NetX Duo requests, including packet transmission, packet reception, and requests for status and control.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a multi-home system, the IP instance has multiple interfaces, each with an associated network driver that performs these tasks for the respective interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The network driver must also handle asynchronous events occurring on the media. Asynchronous events from the media include packet reception, packet transmission completion, and status changes. NetX Duo provides the network driver with several access functions to handle various events. These functions are designed to be called from the  interrupt service routine portion of the network driver. For IPv4 networks, the network driver should forward all ARP packets received to the <strong><em>nx_arp_packet_deferred_receive_</strong> internal function. All RARP packets should be forwarded to
<strong></em>nx_rarp_packet_deferred_receive_</strong> internal function. There are two options for IP packets. If fast dispatch of IP packets is required, incoming IP packets should be forwarded to <strong><em>nx_ip_packet_receive_</strong> for immediate processing. This greatly improves NetX Duo performance in handling IP packets. Otherwise, forwarding IP packets to <strong></em>nx_ip_packet_deferred_receive_</strong> should be done. This service places the IP packet in the deferred processing queue where it is then
handled by the internal IP thread, which results in the least amount of ISR processing time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The network driver can also defer interrupt processing to run out of the context of the IP thread. In this mode, the ISR shall save the necessary information, call the internal function <strong><em>_nx_ip_driver_deferred_processing</em></strong>, and acknowledge the interrupt controller. This service notifies IP thread to schedule a callback to the device driver to complete the process of the event that causes the interrupt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some network controllers are capable of performing TCP/IP header checksum computation and validation in hardware, without taking up valuable CPU resources. To take advantage of the hardware capability feature, NetX Duo provides options to enable or disable various software checksum computation at compilation time, as well as turning on or off checksum computation at run time, if the device driver is able to communicate with the IP layer about is hardware capabilities. See <a href="chapter5.html">Chapter 5 - NetX Duo Network Drivers</a> for more detailed information on writing NetX Duo network drivers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_multihome_support">Multihome Support</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>NetX Duo supports systems connected to multiple physical devices using a single IP instance. Each physical interface is assigned to an interface control block in the IP instance. Applications wishing to use a multihome system must define the value for <strong><em>NX_MAX_PHYSICAL_INTERFACES</em></strong> to the number of physical devices attached to the system, and rebuild NetX Duo library. By default <strong><em>NX_MAX_PHYSICAL_INTERFACES</em></strong> is set to one, creating one interface control block in the IP instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The NetX Duo application creates a single IP instance for the primary device using the <strong><em>nx_ip_create</em></strong> service. For each additional network devices, the application attaches the device to the IP instance using the <strong><em>nx_ip_interface_attach</em></strong> service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each network interface structure contains a subset of network information about the network interface that is contained in the IP control block, including interface IPv4 address, subnet mask, IP MTU size, and MAC-layer address information.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, NetX Duo can determine the best source address to use when transmitting a packet. The source address selection is based on the destination address. NetX Duo services are added to allow applications to specify a specific source address to use, in cases where the most suitable one cannot be determined by the destination
address. An example would be in a multihome system, an application needs to send a packet to an IPv4 broadcast or multicast destination addresses.</p>

<h2 id="_protocol_layering">Protocol Layering</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The TCP/IP implemented by NetX Duo is a layered protocol, which means more complex protocols are built on top of simpler underlying protocols. In TCP/IP, the lowest layer protocol is at the <em>link level</em> and is handled by the network driver. This level is typically targeted towards Ethernet, but it could also be fiber, serial, or virtually any physical media.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On top of the link layer is the <em>network layer</em>. In TCP/IP, this is the IP, which is basically responsible for sending and receiving simple packets&#8212;&#8203;in a best-effort manner&#8212;&#8203;across the network.
Management-type protocols like ICMP and IGMP are typically also categorized as network layers, even though they rely on IP for sending and receiving.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>transport layer</em> rests on top of the network layer. This layer is responsible for managing the flow of data between hosts on the network. There are two types of transport services supported by NetX
Duo: UDP and TCP. UDP services provide best-effort sending and receiving of data between two hosts in a connectionless manner, while TCP provides reliable connection-oriented service between two host entities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This layering is reflected in the actual network data packets. Each layer in TCP/IP contains a block of information called a header. This technique of surrounding data (and possibly protocol information) with
a header is typically called data encapsulation. Figure 1 shows an example of NetX Duo layering and Figure 2 shows the resulting data encapsulation for UDP data being sent.</p>

<h2 id="_packet_pools">Packet Pools</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Allocating packets in a fast and deterministic manner is always a challenge in real-time networking applications. With this in mind, NetX Duo provides the ability to create and manage multiple pools of
fixed-size network packets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because NetX Duo packet pools consist of fixed-size memory blocks, there are never any internal fragmentation problems. Of course, fragmentation causes behavior that is inherently nondeterministic. In addition, the time required to allocate and free a NetX Duo packet amounts to simple linked-list manipulation. Furthermore, packet allocation and deallocation is done at the head of the available list. This provides the fastest possible linked list processing.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>FIGURE 2. UDP Data Encapsulation</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lack of flexibility is typically the main drawback of fixed-size packet pools. Determining the optimal packet payload size that also handles the worst-case incoming packet is a difficult task. NetX Duo packets address this problem with an optional feature called packet chaining. An actual network packet can be made of one or more NetX Duo packets linked together. In addition, the packet header maintains a pointer to the top of the packet. As additional protocols are added, this pointer is simply moved backwards and the new header is written directly in front of the data. Without the flexible packet technology, the stack would have to allocate another buffer and copy the data into a new buffer with the new header, which is processing intensive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since each packet payload size is fixed for a given packet pool, application data larger than the payload size would require multiple packets chained together. When filling a packet with user data, the
application shall use the service <strong><em>nx_packet_data_append</em></strong>. This service moves application data into a packet. In situations where a packet is not enough to hold user data, additional packets are
allocated to store user data. To use packet chaining, the driver must be able to receive into or transmit from chained packets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For embedded systems that do not need to use the packet chaining feature, the NetX Duo library can
be built with <strong><em>NX_DISABLE_PACKET_CHAIN</em></strong> to remove the packet chaining logic. Note that the IP fragmentation and reassembly feature may need to utilize the chained packet feature. Therefore defining <strong><em>NX_DISABLE_PACKET_CHAIN</em></strong> requires <strong><em>NX_DISABLE_FRAGMENTATION</em></strong> also be defined.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each NetX Duo packet memory pool is a public resource. NetX Duo places no constraints on how packet pools are used.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_packet_pool_memory_area">Packet Pool Memory Area</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The memory area for the packet pool is specified during creation. Like other memory areas for ThreadX and NetX Duo objects, it can be located anywhere in the target&#8217;s address space.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an important feature because of the considerable flexibility it gives the application. For example, suppose that a communication product has a high-speed memory area for network buffers. This memory area is easily utilized by making it into a NetX Duo packet memory pool.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_creating_packet_pools">Creating Packet Pools</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Packet pools are created either during initialization or during runtime by  application threads. There are no limits on the number of packet memory pools in a NetX Duo application.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_dual_packet_pool">Dual Packet Pool</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typically the payload size of the default IP packet pool is large enough to accommodate frame size up to the network interface MTU. During normal operation, the IP thread needs to send messages such as ARP, TCP control messages, IGMP messages, ICMPv6 messages. These messages use the packets allocated from the default packet pool in the IP instance. On a memory-constrained system where the amount of memory available for packet pool is limited, using a single packet pool (with the large payload size to match MTU size) may not be an optimal solution. NetX Duo allows application to install an auxiliary packet pool, where the payload size is smaller. Once the auxiliary packet pool is installed, the IP helper thread would allocate packets from either the default packet pool or the auxiliary pool, depending on the size of the message it transmits. For an auxiliary packet pool, a payload size of 200 bytes would work with most of the messages the IP helper thread transmits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default NetX Duo library is built without enabling dual packet pool. To enable the feature, build the library with <strong><em>NX_DUAL_PACKET_POOL_ENABLE</em></strong> defined. Then the auxiliary packet pool can be set by calling <strong><em>nx_ip_auxiliary_packet_pool_set</em></strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is also the option of creating more than one packet pool. For example a transmit packet pool is created with optimal payload size for expected message sizes. A receive packet pool is created in the
driver with a payload size set to the driver MTU, since one cannot predict the size of received packets.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_packet_header_nx_packet">Packet Header NX_PACKET</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, NetX Duo places the packet header immediately before the packet payload area. The packet memory pool is basically a series of packets-- headers followed immediately by the
packet payload. The packet header (<strong><em>NX_PACKET</em></strong>) and the layout of the packet pool are pictured in Figure 3.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For network devices driver that are able to perform zero copy operations, typically the starting address of the packet payload area is programmed into the DMA logic. Certain DMA engines have alignment
requirement on the payload area. To make the starting address of the payload area align properly for the DMA engine, or the cache operation, the user can define the symbol <strong><em>NX_PACKET_ALIGNMENT</em></strong>.</p>

<h3 id="_creating_ip_instances">Creating IP Instances</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IP instances are created either during initialization or during runtime by application threads. The initial IPv4 address, network mask, default packet pool, media driver, and memory and priority of the internal IP thread are defined by the <strong><em>nx_ip_create</em></strong>service even if the application intends to use IPv6 networks only. If the application initializes the IP instance with its IPv4 address set to an invalid address(0.0.0.0), it is assumed that the interface address is going to resolved by manual configuration later, via RARP, or through DHCP or similar protocols.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For systems with multiple network interfaces, the primary interface is designated when calling <strong><em>nx_ip_create</em></strong>. Each additional interface can be attached to the same IP instance by calling <strong><em>nx_ip_interface_attach</em></strong>. This service stores information about the network interface (such as IP
address, network mask) in the interface control block, and associates the driver instance with the interface control block in the IP instance. As the driver receives a data packet, it needs to store the
interface information in the NX_PACKET structure before forwarding it to the IP receive logic. Note an IP instance must already be created before attaching any interfaces.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IPv6 services are not started after calling <strong><em>nx_ip_create</em></strong>. Applications wishing to use IPv6 services must call the service <strong><em>nx_ipv6_enable</em></strong> to start IPv6.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the IPv6 network, each interface in an IP instance may have multiple IPv6 global addresses. In addition to using DHCPv6 for IPv6 address assignment, a device may also use Stateless Address Autoconfiguration. More information is available in the "IP Control Block" and "IPv6 Address Resolution"

The IP header is completed (with all the options specified by the calling protocol layer), the IP checksum is computed in-line (for IPv4 packets only), and the packet is dispatched to the associated network driver. In addition, outgoing fragmentation is also coordinated from within the IP send processing.</p>

<h3 id="_raw_ip_send">Raw IP Send</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A raw IP packet is an IP frame that contains upper layer protocol payload not directly supported (and processed) by NetX Duo. A raw packet allows developers to define their own IP-based applications. An application may send raw IP packets directly using the <strong><em>nxd_ip_raw_packet_send</em></strong> service if raw IP packet processing has been enabled with the <strong><em>nx_ip_raw_packet_enabled</em></strong> service. When transmitting a unicast packet on an IPv6 network, NetX Duo automatically determines the best source IPv6 address to use to send the packets out on, based on the destination address. If the destination address is a multicast (or broadcast for IPv4) address, however, NetX Duo will default to the first (primary) interface. Therefore, to send such packets out on secondary interfaces, the application must use the <strong><em>nx_ip_raw_packet_source_send</em></strong> service to specify the source address to use for the outgoing packet.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_raw_ip_receive">Raw IP Receive</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If raw IP packet processing is enabled, the application may receive raw IP packets through the <strong><em>nx_ip_raw_packet_receive</em></strong> service. All incoming packets are processed according to the protocol specified in the IP header. If the protocol specifies UDP, TCP, IGMP or ICMP, NetX Duo will process the packet using the appropriate handler for the packet protocol type. If the protocol is not one of these protocols, and raw IP receive is enabled, the incoming packet will be put into the raw packet queue waiting for the application to receive it via the <strong><em>nx_ip_raw_packet_receive</em></strong> service. In addition, application threads may suspend with an optional timeout while waiting for a raw
IP packet. The number of packets that can be queued on the raw packet queue is limited. The maximum value is defined in <strong><em>NX_IP_RAW_MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH</em></strong>, whose default value is 20. An application may change the maximum value by calling the <strong><em>nx_ip_raw_receive_queue_max_set</em></strong> service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, the NetX Duo library may be built with <strong><em>NX_ENABLE_IP_RAW_PACKET_FILTER</em>.</strong> In this mode of operation, the application provides a callback function that is invoked every time a packet with an unhandled protocol type is received. The IP receive logic forwards the packet to the user-defined raw packet receive filter routine. The filter routine decides whether or not to keep the raw packet for future process. The return value from the callback routine indicates whether the packet has been processed by the raw packet receive filter. If the packet is processed by the callback function, the packet should be released after the application is done with the packet. Otherwise, NetX Duo is responsible for releasing the packet. Refer to the <strong><em>nx_ip_raw_packet_filter_set</em></strong> for more information on how to use the raw packet filter function.</p>

The default interval 10 seconds can be redefined by <strong><em>NX_ARP_DEFEND_INTERVAL</em></strong>. This behavior follows the policy specified in 2.4(c) of RFC5227.

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is the protocol for requesting network assignment of the host&#8217;s 32-bit IP addresses (RFC 903). This is done through an RARP request and continues periodically until a network member assigns an IP address to the host network interface in an RARP response. The application creates an IP instance by the service <strong><em>nx_ip_create</em></strong> with a zero IP address. If RARP is enabled by the application, it can use the RARP protocol to request an IP address from the network server accessible through the interface that has a zero IP address.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_rarp_enable">RARP Enable</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use RARP, the application must create the IP instance with an IP address of zero, then enable RARP using the service <strong><em>nx_rarp_enable</em></strong>. For multihome systems, at least one network device associated with the IP instance must have an IP address of zero. The RARP processing periodically sends RARP request messages for the NetX Duo system requiring an IP address until a valid RARP reply with the network designated IP address is received. At this point, RARP processing is complete.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After RARP has been enabled, it is disabled automatically after all interface addresses are resolved. The application may force RARP to terminate by using the service <strong><em>nx_rarp_disable</em></strong>.</p>

<h3 id="_ipv6_addresses">IPv6 Addresses</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IPv6 addresses are 128 bits. The architecture of IPv6 address is described in RFC 4291. The address is divided into a prefix containing the most significant bits and a host address containing the lower bits. The prefix indicates the type of address and is roughly the equivalent of the network address in IPv4 network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IPv6 has three types of address specifications: unicast, anycast (not supported in NetX Duo), and multicast. Unicast addresses are those IP addresses that identify a specific host on the Internet. Unicast addresses can be either a source or a destination IP address. Multicast addresses specify a dynamic group of hosts on the Internet. Members of the multicast group may join and leave whenever they wish.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IPv6 does not have the equivalent of the IPv4 broadcast mechanism. The ability to send a packet to all hosts can be achieved by sending a packet to the link-local all hosts multicast group.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IPv6 utilizes multicast addresses to perform Neighbor Discovery, Router Discovery, and Stateless Address Auto Configuration procedures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two types of IPv6 unicast addresses: link local addresses, typically constructed by combining the well-known link local prefix with the interface MAC address, and global IP addresses, which also has the prefix portion and the host ID portion. A global address may be configured manually, or through the Stateless Address Autoconfiguration or DHCPv6. NetX Duo supports both link local address and global address.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To accommodate both IPv4 and IPv6 formats, NetX Duo provides a new data type, NXD_ADDRESS, for holding IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The definition of this structure is shown below. The address field is a union of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">typedef struct NXD_ADDRESS_STRUCT
{
    ULONG nxd_ip_version;
    union
    {
        ULONG v4;
        ULONG v6[4];
    } nxd_ip_address;
} NXD_ADDRESS;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the NXD_ADDRESS structure, the first element, <em>nxd_ip_version</em>, indicates IPv4 or IPv6 version. Supported values are either NX_IP_VERSION_V4 or NX_IP_VERSION_V6. <em>nxd_ip_version</em> indicates which field in the <em>nxd_ip_address</em> union to use as the IP address. NetX Duo API services typically take a pointer to NXD_ADDRESS structure as input argument in lieu of the ULONG (32 bit) IP address.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_link_local_addresses">Link Local Addresses</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A link-local address is only valid on the local network. A device can send and receive packets to another device on the same network after a valid link local address is assigned to it. An application assigns a link-local address by calling the NetX Duo service <strong><em>nxd_ipv6_address_set</em></strong>, with the prefix length parameter set to 10. The application may supply a link-local address to the service, or it may simply use NX_NULL as the link-local address and allow NetX Duo to construct a link-local address based on the device&#8217;s MAC address.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following example instructs NetX Duo to configure the link-local address with a prefix length of 10 on the primary device (index 0) using its MAC address:</p>

<p>After a system configures its IPv6 address, the address is marked as <em>TENTATIVE</em>. If Duplicate Address Detection (DAD), described in RFC 4862, is enabled, NetX Duo automatically sends neighbor solicitation (NS) messages with this tentative address as the destination. If no hosts on the network respond to these NS messages within a given period of time, the address is assumed to be unique on the local link, and its state transits to the VALID state. At this point the application may start using this IP address for communication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The DAD functionality is part of the ICMPv6 module. Therefore, the application must enable ICMPv6 services before a newly configured address can go through the DAD process. Alternatively, the DAD
process may be turned off by defining <strong><em>NX_DISABLE_IPV6_DAD</em></strong> option in the NetX Duo library build environment (defined as <strong><em>nx_user.h</em></strong>). During the DAD process, the <strong><em>NX_IPV6_DAD_TRANSMITS</em></strong> parameter determines the number of NS messages sent by NetX Duo without receiving a response to determine that the address is unique. By default and recommended by RFC 4862, <strong><em>NX_IPV6_DAD_TRANSMITS</em></strong> is set at 3. Setting this symbol to zero effectively disables DAD.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If ICMPv6 or DAD is not enabled at the time the application assigns an IPv6 address, DAD is not performed and NetX Duo sets the state of the IPv6 address to VALID immediately.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multicast addresses specify a dynamic group of hosts on the Internet. Members of the multicast group may join and leave whenever they wish. NetX Duo implements several ICMPv6 protocols, including Duplicate Address Detection, Neighbor Discovery, and Router Discovery, which require IP multicast capability. Therefore, NetX Duo expects the underlying device driver to support multicast operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When NetX Duo needs to join or leave a multicast group (such as the all-node multicast address, and the <em>solicited-node</em> multicast address), it issues a driver command to the device driver to join or leave a multicast MAC address. The driver command for joining the multicast address is <strong><em>NX_LINK_MULTICAST_JOIN</em></strong>. To leave a multicast address, NetX Duo issues the driver command <strong><em>NX_LINK_MULTICAST_LEAVE</em></strong>. The device driver must implement these two commands for ICMPv6 protocols to work properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applications may join an IPv6 multicast group by using the service <strong><em>nxd_ipv6_multicast_interface_join</em>.</strong> This service registers the multicast address with the IP stack, and then notifies the specified device driver of the IPv6 multicast address. To leave a
multicast group, applications use the service <strong><em>nxd_ipv6_multicast_interface_leave.</em></strong></p>

<h3 id="_neighbor_discovery_nd">Neighbor Discovery (ND)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Neighbor Discovery is a protocol in IPv6 networks for mapping physical addresses to the IPv6 addresses (global address or link-local address). This mapping is maintained in the Neighbor Discovery Cache (ND Cache). The ND process is the equivalent of the ARP process in IPv4, and the ND Cache is similar to the ARP table. An IPv6 node can obtain its neighbor&#8217;s MAC address using the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol. It sends out a neighbor solicitation (NS) message to the all-node solicited node multicast address, and waits for a corresponding neighbor advertisement (NA) message. The MAC address obtained through this process is stored in the ND Cache.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each IP instance has one ND cache. The ND Cache is maintained as an array of entries. The size of the array is defined at compilation time by setting the option <strong><em>NX_IPV6_NEIGHBOR_CACHE_SIZE</em></strong> which in <strong><em>nx_user.h</em></strong>. Note that all interfaces attached to an IP instance share the same ND cache.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The entire ND Cache is empty when NetX Duo starts up. As the system runs, NetX Duo automatically updates the ND Cache, adding and deleting entries as per ND protocol. However, an application may also update the ND Cache by manually adding and deleting cache entries using the following NetX Duo services:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>nxd_nd_cache_entry_delete</em></strong></p>

<p>Neighbor Unreachability Detection, Router Discovery, and Prefix Discovery are based on the Neighbor Discovery protocol and are described below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Neighbor Unreachability Detection:</em></strong> An IPv6 device searches its Neighbor Discovery (ND) Cache for the destination link layer address when it wishes to send a packet. The immediate destination, sometimes referred to as the 'next hop,' may be the actual destination on the same link or it may be a router if the destination is off link. An ND cache entry contains the status on a neighbor&#8217;s reachability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A REACHABLE status indicates the neighbor is considered reachable. A neighbor is reachable if it has recently received confirmation that packets sent to the neighbor have been received. Confirmation in NetX Duo take the form of receiving an NA message from the neighbor in response to an NS message sent by the NetX Duo device. NetX Duo will also change the state of the neighbor status to REACHABLE if the
application calls the NetX Duo service <strong><em>nxd_nd_cache_entry_set</em></strong> to manually enter a cache record.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Router Discovery:</em></strong> An IPv6 device uses a router to forward all packets intended for off link destinations. It may also use information sent by the router, such as router advertisement (RA) messages, to configure its global IPv6 addresses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A device on the network may initiate the Router Discovery process by sending a router solicitation (RS) message to the all-router multicast address (FF01::2). Or it can wait on the all-node multicast address (FF::1) for a periodic RA from the routers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An RA message contains the prefix information for configuring an IPv6 address for that network. In NetX Duo, router solicitation is by default enabled and can be disabled by setting the configuration option <strong><em>NX_DISABLE_ICMPV6_ROUTER_SOLICITATION</em></strong> in <strong><em>nx_user.h</em></strong>. See Configuration Options in the "Installation and Use of NetX Duo" chapter for more details on setting Router Solicitation parameters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Prefix Discovery</em></strong>: An IPv6 device uses prefix discovery to learn which target hosts are accessible directly without going through a router. This information is made available to the IPv6 device from RA messages from the router. The IPv6 device stores the prefix information in a prefix table. Prefix discovery is matching a prefix from the IPv6 device prefix table to a target address. A prefix matches a target address if all the bits in the prefix match the most significant bits of the target address. If more than one prefix covers an address, the longest prefix is selected.</p>

<p>The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides the simplest form of data transfer between network members (RFC 768). UDP data packets are sent from one network member to another in a best effort fashion; i.e., there is no built-in mechanism for acknowledgement by the packet recipient. In addition, sending a UDP packet does not require any connection to be established in advance. Because of this, UDP packet transmission is very efficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For developers migrating their NetX applications to NetX Duo there are only a few basic changes in UDP functionality between NetX and NetX Duo. This is because IPv6 is primarily concerned with the underlying

<p>UDP places a simple packet header in front of the application&#8217;s data on transmission, and removes a

<h3 id="_udp_checksum">UDP Checksum</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IPv6 protocol requires a UDP header checksum computation on packet data, whereas in the IPv4 protocol it is optional.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>UDP specifies a one&#8217;s complement 16-bit checksum that covers the IP pseudo header (consisting of the source IP address, destination IP address, and the protocol/length IP word), the UDP header, and the UDP packet data. The only differences between IPv4 and IPv6 UDP packet header checksums is that the source and destination IP addresses are 32 bit in IPv4 while in IPv6 they are 128 bit. If the calculated UDP checksum is 0, it is stored as all ones (0xFFFF). If the sending socket has the UDP checksum logic disabled, a zero is placed in the UDP checksum field to indicate the checksum was not calculated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the UDP checksum does not match the computed checksum by the receiver, the UDP packet is simply discarded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the IPv4 network, UDP checksum is optional. NetX Duo allows an application to enable or disable UDP checksum calculation on a per-socket basis. By default, the UDP socket checksum logic is enabled. The application can disable checksum logic for a particular UDP socket by calling the <strong><em>nx_udp_socket_checksum_disable</em></strong> service. On the IPv6 network, however, UDP checksum is mandatory. Therefore, the service <strong><em>nx_udp_socket_checksum_disable</em></strong> would not disable UDP checksum logic when sending a packet through the IPv6 network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Certain Ethernet controllers are able to generate the UDP checksum on the fly. If the system is able to use hardware checksum computation feature, the NetX Duo library can be built without the checksum logic. To disable UDP software checksum, the NetX Duo library must be built with the following symbols defined: <strong><em>NX_DISABLE_UDP_TX_CHECKSUM</em></strong> and <strong><em>NX_DISABLE_UDP_RX_CHECKSUM</em></strong> (described in Chapter two). The configuration options remove UDP checksum logic from NetX Duo entirely, while calling the <strong><em>nx_udp_socket_checksum_disable</em></strong> service allows the application to disable IPv4 UDP checksum processing on a per socket basis.</p>

<p>A UDP port is a logical end point in the UDP protocol. There are 65,535 valid ports in the UDP component of NetX Duo, ranging from 1 through 0xFFFF. To send or receive UDP data, the application must first create a UDP socket, then bind it to a desired port. After binding a UDP socket to a port, the application may send and receive data on that socket.</p>

<p>The UDP Fast Path is the name for a low packet overhead path through the NetX Duo UDP implementation. Sending a UDP packet requires just a few function calls: <strong><em>nx_udp_socket_send</em></strong>, <strong><em>nx_ip_packet_send</em></strong>, and the eventual call to the network driver. <strong><em>nx_udp_socket_send</em></strong> is available in NetX Duo for existing NetX applications and is only applicable for IPv4 packets. The preferred method, however, is to use <strong><em>nxd_udp_socket_send</em></strong> service discussed below. On UDP packet reception, the UDP packet is either placed on the appropriate UDP socket receive queue or delivered to a suspended application thread in a single function call from the network driver&#8217;s receive interrupt processing. This highly optimized logic for sending and receiving UDP packets is the essence of UDP Fast Path technology.</p>

<h3 id="_udp_packet_send">UDP Packet Send</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sending UDP data over IPv6 or IPv4 networks is easily accomplished by calling the <strong><em>nxd_udp_socket_send</em></strong> function. The caller must set the IP version in the <em>nx_ip_version</em> field of the NXD_ADDRESS pointer parameter. NetX Duo will determine the best source address for transmitted UDP packets based on the destination IPv4/IPv6 address. This service places a UDP header in front of the packet data and sends it out onto the network using an internal IP send routine. There is no thread suspension on sending UDP packets because all UDP packet transmissions are processed immediately.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For multicast or broadcast destinations, the application should specify the source IP address to use if the NetX Duo device has multiple IP addresses to choose from. This can be done with the services <strong><em>nxd_udp_socket_source_send.</em></strong></p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Certain network controllers are able to perform TCP checksum computation and validation in hardware. For such systems, applications may want to use hardware checksum logic as much as possible to reduce runtime overhead. Applications may disable TCP checksum computation logic from the NetX Duo library altogether at build time by defining <strong><em>NX_DISABLE_TCP_TX_CHECKSUM</em></strong> and <strong><em>NX_DISABLE_TCP_RX_CHECKSUM</em></strong>. This way, the TCP checksum code is not compiled in. However one should exercise caution if the optional NetX Duo IPsec package is installed, and the TCP connection may need to traverse through a secure channel. In this case, data in packets belonging to the TCP connection is already encrypted, and most hardware TCP checksum modules present in the network driver are unable to generate correct checksum value from the encrypted TCP payload.</p>

<p>The connection between two TCP sockets (one client and one server) is complex and is managed in a state machine manner. Each TCP socket starts in a CLOSED state. Through connection events each socket&#8217;s state machine migrates into the ESTABLISHED state, which is where the bulk of the data transfer in TCP takes place. When one side of the connection no longer wishes to send data, it disconnects. After the other side disconnects, eventually the TCP socket returns to the CLOSED state. This process repeats each time a TCP client and server establish and close a connection. Figure 14 shows the various states of the TCP state machine.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, the client side of the TCP connection initiates a connection request to a TCP server. Before a connection request can be made, TCP must be enabled on the client IP instance. In addition, the client TCP socket must next be created with the <strong><em>nx_tcp_socket_create</em></strong> service and bound to a port via the <strong><em>nx_tcp_client_socket_bind</em></strong> service.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the client socket is bound, the <strong><em>nxd_tcp_client_socket_connect</em></strong> service is used to establish a connection with a TCP server. Note the socket must be in a CLOSED state to initiate a connection attempt. Establishing the connection starts with NetX Duo issuing a SYN packet and then waiting for a SYN ACK packet back from the server, which signifies acceptance of the connection request. After the SYN ACK is received, NetX Duo responds with an ACK packet and promotes the client socket to the ESTABLISHED state.</p>

Applications wishing to perform MSS validation shall define <strong><em>NX_ENABLE_TCP_MSS_CHECK</em></strong> when building the NetX Duo library, and the minimum value shall be defined in <strong><em>NX_TCP_MSS_MINIMUM</em></strong>. Incoming TCP connections with MSS values below <strong><em>NX_TCP_MSS_MINIMUM</em></strong> are dropped.</p>

<h3 id="_stop_listening_on_a_server_port">Stop Listening on a Server Port</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the application no longer wishes to listen for client connection requests on a server port that was previously specified by a call to the <strong><em>nx_tcp_server_socket_listen</em></strong> service, the application simply calls the <strong><em>nx_tcp_server_socket_unlisten</em></strong> service. This service places any socket waiting for a connection back in the CLOSED state and releases any queued client connection request packets.</p>

<h3 id="_tcp_window_size">TCP Window Size</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During both the setup and data transfer phases of the connection, each port reports the amount of data it can handle, which is called its window size. As data are received and processed, this window size is adjusted dynamically. In TCP, a sender can only send an amount of data that fits into the receiver&#8217;s window. In essence, the window size provides flow control for data transfer in each direction of the connection.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_tcp_packet_send">TCP Packet Send</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sending TCP data is easily accomplished by calling the <strong><em>nx_tcp_socket_send</em></strong> function. If the size of the data being transmitted is larger than the MSS value of the socket or the current peer receive window size, whichever is smaller, TCP internal logic carves off the data that fits into min (MSS, peer receive Window) for transmission. This service then builds a TCP header in front of the packet (including the checksum calculation). If the receiver&#8217;s window size is not zero, the caller will send as much data as it can to fill up the receiver window size. If the receive window becomes zero, the caller may suspend and wait for the receiver&#8217;s window size to increase enough for this packet to be sent. At any given time, multiple threads may suspend while trying to send data through the same socket.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>TCP Keepalive feature allows a socket to detect whether or not its peer disconnects without proper termination (for example, the peer crashed), or to prevent certain network monitoring facilities to terminate a connection for long periods of idle. TCP Keepalive works by periodically sending a TCP frame with no data, and the sequence number set to one less than the current sequence number. On receiving such TCP Keepalive frame, the recipient, if still alive, responses with an ACK for its current sequence number. This completes the keepalive transaction.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Multiple Registration Protocol (MRP) is a protocol that provides dynamic registration and deregistration of attributes in a network. It is used to manage resources in a network, such as VLANs, multicast addresses, and streams. MRP operates uses a common state machine and attribute propagation mechanisms to provide a consistent view of the network resources. MRP is used by other protocols, such as MVRP (Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol) and MSRP (Multiple Stream Registration Protocol), to provide dynamic registration of VLANs and streams, respectively.</p>
